# Git the Right Guy
## Human Resource Portal for GitHub Applicants 

## The Gist
This app was constructed for the HR department of an imaginary company. The client needed the ability to find GitHub users based on their real names or email addresses. Other requirments included, but were not limited to: 
- Use of a modenr JS framework.
- Search form.
- Single page application, with search results displayed on the same page as the search form.
- Results including the following information: 
- - Username
- - Real Name
- - Avatar
- - Location
- - Email
- - Number of Public Repos
- - Account Creation Date
- - Last Update Date
- Limited results.
- Link to User's GitHub Profile.

For this project, I implimented the use of the GitHub API, displayed the results via the use of React functional components, and used Redux to manage application state.
